# ðŸ’µ Voicee Pay - Banking for all
Building the Best Digital Banking system for all

## ðŸ§µ Architecture Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](/images/architecture-diagram-flow.png)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Django
- React
- GraphQL
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Africa Talking USSD Service
- Google DialogFlow Phone Gateway
- Azure Web Apps
- Azure Container Registry

## ðŸ“Œ Points to remember
- It takes some time to spin up both the React and Django containers if you're clicking the link for the `first time` or after a `long pause` so the the link might take around a minute to show both the **`React Dashboard and Django Admin Page`**
- You need to create a bank account so that it can be linked to the customer (first create the bank account and then add it to the customer) - Just incase you want to create a new customer
- Have the Django Admin Page up before calling the Google DialogFlow Phone Gateway number because if the Django container is not running the webhook from DialogFlow will not be captured
- Reach out to `santhoshkdhana@gmail.com` for clarifications
