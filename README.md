## âš™ How to test Google DialogFlow 
- Install Skype (we need this because we have a US based Toll-Free number)
- Call `+1 833-208-4225` on your Skype App
- A bot will welcome you
- Ask `mera sitee kaard kaise blok karen` (you can use any from the intents in the Google DialogFlow intents list)
- It would give you an answer and ask for a feedback
- Respond `achchha` (anything appropriate)
- This will be recorded in the database via a callback function in Google DialogFlow
- Check the Feedbacks tab in the Django Administration page [here](https://sandy-voicee-pay-django.azurewebsites.net/admin/transaction/feedback/) to check for the feedback received

## âš™ How to test USSD
- Open [Africa Talking Simulator - No login required](https://developers.africastalking.com/simulator)
- Use `9834473278` when asked for a phone number (if you get `Failed to launch. Kindly try again.` accept the cookies in the lower left-corner to make this work)
- Once in, pick the language of your choice (not working - Kannada,Telugu - the language phrases are yet to be updated)
- Enter 1, you'll be presented with the balance of your account. This can be verified in the Django Admin Dashboard
- Click call again, and select the language and enter 2.
- Enter 1080-1376-6276-8838,100 and you'll be presented with the result of the transaction. This can also be verified in the Transaction view of the Django Admin Dashboard
 - Entering 3 will exit you out of the application with the thank you note.
- The [React Dashboard](https://sandy-voicee-pay-react.azurewebsites.net/dashboard) will be updated for every USSD action performed by the user and for every transaction made.

## ðŸ”Ž How to view Google DialogFlow work
- Open [Google DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/)
- create an agent
- Head over to the settings and click `Export and Import tab`
- Upload the agents from the `Google DialogFlow Agents folder`
- Now you'll be able to view all the intents the bot was trained on

### ðŸ™Œ Special thanks to all my friends from all over India for helping me with the language phrases
- Shanmuganathan
- Ivin Varghese
- Aishwarya Rao
- Bratati Ganguly
- Vaishali Mane
- Chandu Sree

## ðŸ“Œ FAQs and Points to remember
- It takes some time to spin up both the React and Django containers if you're using it for the `first time` or after a `long pause`
- You need to create a bank account so that it can be linked to the customer (first create the bank account and then add it to the customer)
- Have the Django Admin Page up before calling the Google DialogFlow Phone Gateway number because if the Django container is not running the webhook from DialogFlow will not be captured

## âœˆ Future Work
- Add more languages to the USSD service
- Add more intents to Google DialogFlow agent
- Login page for React Dashboard
- Spin up Postgres for storage
- Deploy Django and React containers to Kubernetes
- Better error handling for USSD sessions
